# RachitTracer
Utilizing WebGL and shaders to implement raytracing! The implementation follows Pete Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", but instead of C++, it is done in a fragment shader for a flat WebGL quad. This allows the code to run faster than a CPU implementation, but the shader language is very basic and lacks the features of a modern, higher-level language. It does have a robust Vector3 type, allowing me to skip all the work of implementing one by myself. The actual code for the shaders can be found in script tags located in the `index.html` file, and the `index.js` file just sets up the WebGL canvas and quad using the TWGLJS library.


NOT DONE!!! I WILL WORK ON THIS WHENEVER I FEEL LIKE IT AND WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT RAYTRACING!
